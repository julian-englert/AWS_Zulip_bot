# AWS_Zulip_bot
This repository shows how to write a bot for Zulip that runs on AWS and sends scheduled messages to streams or to users.

This can be used for example to post a daily quote into your organization's Zulip or check-in message at the beginning or the end of the day asking your team members about the work they planned and finished.

Below is a schematic outlining the process flow.
